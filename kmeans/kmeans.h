	//! kmeans clusters data into k groups
	/*! 

	  \param iterations How many iterations to run
	  \param n Number of data points
	  \param d Number of dimensions
	  \param k Number of clusters
	  \param data Data points, in row-major order. This vector must have
	  size n * d, and since it's in row-major order, data point x occupies
	  positions [x * d, (x + 1) * d) in the vector. The vector is passed
	  by reference since it is shared with the caller and not copied.
	  \param labels Cluster labels. This vector has size n.
	  The vector is passed by reference since it is shared with the caller
	  and not copied.
	  \param centroids Centroid locations, in row-major order. This
	  vector must have size k * d, and since it's in row-major order,
	  centroid x occupies positions [x * d, (x + 1) * d) in the
	  vector. The vector is passed by reference since it is shared
	  with the caller and not copied.
	  \param distances Distances from points to centroids. This vector has
	  size n. It is passed by reference since it is shared with the caller
	  and not copied.
	  \param init_from_labels If true, the labels need to be initialized
	  before calling kmeans. If false, the centroids need to be
	  initialized before calling kmeans. Defaults to true, which means
	  the labels must be initialized.
	  \param threshold This controls early termination of the kmeans
	  iterations. If the ratio of the sum of distances from points to
	  centroids from this iteration to the previous iteration changes by
	  less than the threshold, than the iterations are
	  terminated. Defaults to 0.000001
	  \return The number of iterations actually performed.
