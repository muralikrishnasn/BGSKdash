- Place some results files in a folder.
	The results files are the one outputted by the Python or Matlab code.
- Change the path in MethodsRanker.py for the folder you created.
- Run MethodsRanker.py.
	It will output a sorted list of methods with a relative score for each methods.
	The rank is not the one you will have on the changedetection website because
	it's relative to the other methods in the folder, not the one on the website.

There's no Matlab version of this program.
